# Student Service Web Application

App can be accessed here: http://194.37.80.94:8080

## Description

In our university there are many administrative issues and questions sent by students to coordinators via e-mail
which makes troubleshooting unorganized, hard to manage and uncomfortable to do. Therefore, we would like to implement
a web service that manages communication between students and coordinators and other administrative persons much
simpler and faster. Logging in as a student there will be an interface for choosing the issue category and submitting
the request which will be sent to the proper administrative people in an organized way to make the problem obvious from
the first sight. As for coordinators' interface , there will be all the features needed to sort and to handle issues
like to get some template answers or putting the issue into priority category.
