# Project management

## Tasks

Task will be written in GitHub Issues and assigned to each contributor.

## Commit messages

Setup proper configs for your commits.

Like:

* `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`     
* `git config --global user.email "john.doe@inf.elte.hu"`

Let's write super-duper descriptive commit messages! Thanks! 🙏 

## Pull Requests

If you want to add your changes/new features create your own local branch with following pattern: `name/feature_name`

Then push it to remote and create pull request. Merge after PR review to master branch. Finally, delete used branch after merging.

***That's pizdec tactic. Have fun!***
