Hi! 
I'm Ulukbekova Aiperi and I'm from Kyrgyzstan. 
My goal is to try different kinds of food in the world. 
My hobbies are drawing and chilling.
I know basic HTML, CSS and C++. 
Gonna do my best to work with you 

If you have any questions (even if it is about cats), feel free to write me ;)
You can find me in Facebook by my name.
